;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides Emacs integration with Shortcut (https://www.shortcut.com),
;; a project management platform.  It allows you to interact with Shortcut stories,
;; epics, iterations, and other entities directly from Emacs.

;;; Code:

(require 'url)
(require 'json)

(defgroup shortcut nil
  "Emacs integration for Shortcut project management."
  :group 'tools
  :prefix "shortcut-")

(defcustom shortcut-api-token (getenv "SHORTCUT_API_TOKEN")
  "API token for authenticating with Shortcut.
If nil, the token will be read from the SHORTCUT_API_TOKEN environment variable.
You can generate a token at https://app.shortcut.com/settings/account/api-tokens"
  :type 'string
  :group 'shortcut)

(defcustom shortcut-api-base-url "https://api.app.shortcut.com/api/v3"
  "Base URL for the Shortcut API."
  :type 'string
  :group 'shortcut)

(provide 'shortcut)

;;; shortcut.el ends here
